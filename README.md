# ExploreMo
The app, "Experience Morocco," will serve as a marketplace connecting activity providers with tourists seeking unique experiences. Providers, such as tour guides, local artisans, or adventure companies, can create detailed listings of their activities, including photos, descriptions, pricing, and availability. Tourists can explore these listings using filters like location, price, and type of experience, or view them on an interactive map. Once an activity catches their interest, they can book it directly through the app’s secure payment system or contact the provider for more details using the in-app chat. Travelers can leave reviews after completing activities, helping others make informed decisions. Notifications will keep users updated on bookings, reminders, and exclusive offers, while multilingual support ensures accessibility for both locals and international visitors. By fostering a direct connection between providers and tourists, the app simplifies the discovery and booking process, creating a seamless and engaging experience for everyone
